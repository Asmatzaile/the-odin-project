# Hangman
This project is part of the The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

## Game description
In Hangman, one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Instructions
This version is played on the command line against the computer.  
At the start, you have the option of choosing between creating a new game or loading a previously saved game.  
Every turn, you can guess a letter or save the game. If you make a guess, the computer will tell you the location of the letter in the word if it was correct, or you will lose a life if it was incorrect.  
To play this game, download the repository and run hangman.rb in the command line.
